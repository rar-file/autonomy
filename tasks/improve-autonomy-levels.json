  "verification": "Implemented 3-tier autonomy system: 1) SUPERVISED - All actions require explicit approval (learning mode), 2) SEMI-AUTONOMOUS - Balanced automation with safety checks (default), 3) FULLY-AUTONOMOUS - Maximum automation within hard limits. Each level has distinct auto-approve and requires-approval lists. Created lib/autonomy-levels.sh for level management, integrated with main autonomy script via 'autonomy level' command. Status display shows current level. Tested all 3 levels successfully.",
